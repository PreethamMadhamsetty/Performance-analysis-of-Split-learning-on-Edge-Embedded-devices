# Performance-analysis-of-Split-learning-on-Edge-Embedded-devices
This project demonstrates how Split Learning a decentralised Machine Learning model is used to evaluate the performance of when the model is divide between Client and Server, enabling training on edge and embedded devices. Evaluating the performance of split learning on resource-constrained devices is crucial for determining its feasibility and potential in real-world applications.
CIFAR-10: Training and Testing:
CIFAR-10, a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, was used to evaluate the split learning model's performance.
Imagenette: Training and Testing:
Imagenette, a subset of ImageNet, was selected for its broader range of image categories and complexities.
MNIST: Training and Testing:
MNIST, a dataset of hand-written digits, served as a benchmark for assessing the split learning model's performance on simpler tasks.
